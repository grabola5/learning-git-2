     		<p>The heart is a bloom 
				Shoots up through stony ground 
				But there's no room 
				No space to rent in this town 
				You're out of luck and 
				The reason that you had to care 
				The traffic is stuck and 
				You're not moving anywhere 
				You thought you'd found a friend 
				To take you out of this place 
				Someone you could lend a hand 
				In return for grace 

				It's a beautiful day, the sky falls 
				And you feel like it's a beautiful day 
				Don't let it, get away </p>
		<p> You're on the road but you've got no destination 
				You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination 
				You love this town even if it doesnâ€™t' ring true
			You've been all over and it's been all over you </p>

		<p>It's a beautiful day 
				Don't let it, get away 
				It's a beautiful day </p>
