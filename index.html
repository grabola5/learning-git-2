     			<p>The heart is a star<br>
					Shoots up through stony ground<br> 
					But there's no room<br>
					No space to rent in this town<br> 
					You're out of luck and<br> 
					The reason that you had to care<br> 
					The traffic is stuck and<br> 
					You're not moving anywhere<br> 
					You thought you'd found a friend<br> 
					To take you out of this place<br> 
					Someone you could lend a hand<br> 
					In return for grace</p>

				<p>It's a beautiful day, the sky falls<br> 
					And you feel like it's a beautiful day<br> 
					Don't let it, get away </p>
			</div>
			<div class="verse-2">
				<p> You're on the road but you've got no destination<br> 
					You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination<br> 
					You love this town even if it doesnâ€™t' ring true<br>
				You've been all over and it's been all over you </p>

				<p>It's a beautiful day<br> 
					Don't let it, get away<br> 
					It's a beautiful day </p>
			</div>
			<div class="verse-3">
				<p>Touch me, take me to that other place<br> 
					Teach me, I know I'm not a hopeless case </p>
				<p>See the world in green and blue<br> 
					See China right in front of you<br> 
					See the canyons broken by cloud<br> 
					See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out<br> 
					See the Bedouin fires at night<br> 
					See the oil fields at first light and<br> 
					See the bird with a leaf in her mouth<br> 
					After the flood all the colors came out </p>
